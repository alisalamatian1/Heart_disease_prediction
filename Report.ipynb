    "\n",
    "ardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. One of the best ways to reduce the mortality and severity of heart diseases is early detection in an individual.\n",
    "Our dataset is created by hospitals and institutions from three different countries (Hungarian, Cleveland, and VA) and is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The original database involves the variables such as age, sex, chest pain (cp), cholesterol (chol), resting blood pressure (trestbps), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) etc. and a final column which classifies the presence of heart disease (angiographic disease status) where 0 represents the absence of heart disease and 1-4 represents the presence of heart disease.\n",
    "In this project, we seek to utilize some commonly available medical metrics -- age, maximum heart rate achieved, and cholesterol-- to predict whether an individual has heart disease or not.\n"

In the original dataset, 0 indicates absence of heart-disease and [1,4] all represent presence of the same, just with different magnitude. As we were only concerned with the presence(or absence) of heart disease, we changed the numbers to “yes” or “no”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then chose our predictors with the following reasoning: Age - People age 65 and older are much more likely than younger people to suffer a heart attack, to have a stroke, or to develop heart disease and heart failure. . This can be due to the heart not being able to beat fast enough during physical activity or times of stress as it did earlier or due to the buildup of fatty deposits in the walls of arteries over the years. It is also evident from our plot that ss age increases, more proportion of people have heart disease; after the dashed line, representing the mean value, the ratio of people with heart disease is higher. Cholesterol: Increased amounts of cholesterol can build up in the wall of your arteries leading to the thinning of the arteries and ultimately leading to less blood flow to the heart muscle. This can lead to various heart diseases and even heart attacks, in some cases Similarly, we can see in our scatter and histogram plots that people with cholesterol of over 200 mg/dl are more likely to have heart disease. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: A higher heart rate is a good thing that leads to greater fitness A higher heart rate means that the heart is functioning well and is able to pump blood quickly and effectively. Lower maximum heart rate means that either the heart is unable to pump blood at higher speeds or that the person isn't doing activities that allow their heart rate to reach such levels, in most cases. Our plots also show that people who did not get to a certain maximum heart rate, around 140, had a significantly higher chance of heart failure.\n",

    "We did not use the rest of the columns because of three main reasons. Firstly, many of the variables were categorical (or binary), such as \"fbs,\" \"cp,\" \"slope,\" and \"thal,\" and as we are using the euclidean distance in the KNN classification model, we cannot be sure what values to assign to each category. For instance, \"fbs\" is either 0 or 1; zero represents fasting blood sugar of less than 120, and one is for more; these numbers are arbitrarily assigned and are not the best indicators of fasting blood sugar, and we cannot easily reassign numbers. Secondly, some of the columns, including \"oldpeak\" and \"ca\" are missing many values. We decided that adding one less correlated predictor is not worth giving up data on more correlated predictors such as maximum heart rate. Lastly, \"oldpeak\" and some of the other variables, such as \"slope,\" are not commonly accessible, and our main goal of this project is to find an algorithm that can detect heart disease based on accessible information. thalach Finally, we selected the columns that we are going to use in the data analysis and changed the type of \"chol\" and \"thalach\" to numeric as we will be calculating the distance between points and we need numeric-type data.

    "Now, we visualise the data to get an insight into the data and use it to aid in choosing the predictors. Firstly, we visualise the data using scatterplots where we plotted 2 of the 3 predictors on the axes. Also, the points were coloured based on whether they represent “yes” or “no” in the heart disease column. This allowed us to gain some insight which was used to select the predictor variables. After the scatterplot, we used histograms to display the distribution of the predictors over various values of that particular predictor. Again, we colour coded the histogram to represent the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ under the heart disease column. This again allowed us to gain insight similar to that from the scatterplot which was used to select predictors. "

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables we plan on using in our model are: \n",
    "1. Age - [People age 65 and older are much more likely than younger people to suffer a heart attack, to have a stroke, or to develop heart disease and heart failure. ](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/heart-health-and-aging). This can be due to the heart not being able to beat fast enough during physical activity or times of stress as it did earlier or due to the buildup of fatty deposits in the walls of arteries over the years. It is also evident from our plot that ss age increases, more proportion of people have heart disease; after the dashed line, representing the mean value, the ratio of people with heart disease is higher.\n",
    "2. Cholesterol: [Increased amounts of cholesterol can build up in the wall of your arteries leading to the thinning of the arteries and ultimately leading to less blood flow to the heart muscle. This can lead to various heart diseases and even heart attacks, in some cases](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-lower-cholesterol-risk) Similarly, we can see in our scatter and histogram plots that people with cholesterol of over 200 mg/dl are more likely to have heart disease.\n",
    "3. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: [A higher heart rate is a good thing that leads to greater fitness](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/understanding-your-target-heart-rate) A higher heart rate means that the heart is functioning well and is able to pump blood quickly and effectively. Lower maximum heart rate means that either the heart is unable to pump blood at higher speeds or that the person isn't doing activities that allow their heart rate to reach such levels, in most cases. Our plots also show that people who did not get to a certain maximum heart rate, around 140, had a significantly higher chance of heart failure. Furthermore, we are going to use the K-nearest neighbours classification algorithm to classify the new data points. We will first use our training data set to create a recipe and tuning and train the classifier using the cross-validation method. We then make predictions and evaluate our prediction's accuracy using the testing data set and visualize the result in the last step. To visualize the result of our analysis, we propose dividing the predictor variables into certain fixed intervals and figuring out what percentage of the people within that interval actually have heart diseases. This will allow us to create a bar chart with the percentage of people with heart disease on the y-axis and the intervals on the x-axis. In conjunction with this, we can also add an additional bar on each interval depicting the percentage of people with heart disease according to our classification model. This will allow us to see the relationship of the predictors with the target variable on the testing set and also allow us to judge the accuracy of our model.\n"

    "1-We are expecting to find that people with age higher than 50, Serum cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dl and maximum heart rate achieved less than 140  have heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-According to this model, we will be able to predict whether people have heart disease early. So we can give them treatment early and therefore reduce the severity and mortality of heart disease. This will also give us an insight into what causes heart disease and allow for the prevention of heart diseases. \n",
    "\n",
    "3-Instead of predicting whether someone has heart disease or not, we can move over to predict the possibility of the person having heart disease. This will be much better at reducing mortality as even if the person does not have heart disease, we can see if they are at high risk for the disease and treat accordingly."
