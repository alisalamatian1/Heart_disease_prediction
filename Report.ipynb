    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. One of the best ways to reduce the mortality and severity of heart diseases is early detection in an individual.\n",
    "Our dataset is created by hospitals and institutions from three different countries (Hungarian, Cleveland, and VA). The original database(UCI Machine Learning Repository) involves the variables such as age, sex, chest pain (cp), cholesterol (chol), resting blood pressure (trestbps), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) etc. and a final column which classifies the presence of heart disease (angiographic disease status) where 0 represents the absence of heart disease and 1-4 represents the presence of heart disease.\n",
    "In this project, we seek to utilize some commonly available medical metrics -- age, maximum heart rate achieved, and cholesterol-- to predict whether an individual has heart disease or not.\n"

    "We continue with tidying the data by altering the “num” from the original dataset and changing the values [0, 4] to either yes or no. In the original dataset, 0 indicates absence of heart-disease and [1,4] all represent presence of the same, just with different magnitude. As we were only concerned with the presence(or absence) of heart disease, we changed the numbers to “yes” or “no”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then chose our predictors with the following reasoning and based on the figures 1.1 to 2.3 visualized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age - People age 65 and older are much more likely than younger people to suffer a heart attack, to have a stroke, or to develop heart disease and heart failure(“Heart Health and Aging”). This can be due to the heart not being able to beat fast enough during physical activity or times of stress as it did earlier or due to the buildup of fatty deposits in the walls of arteries over the years. It is also evident from firgure 1.1 and 2.1 that as age increases, more proportion of people have heart disease; after the dashed line, representing the mean value, the ratio of people with heart disease is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cholesterol: Increased amounts of cholesterol can build up in the wall of your arteries leading to the thinning of the arteries and ultimately leading to less blood flow to the heart muscle(“Cholesterol and Heart Disease”). This can lead to various heart diseases and even heart attacks, in some cases. Similarly, we can see in figures 1.2 and 2.2 that people with cholesterol of over 200 mg/dl are more likely to have heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: A higher heart rate is a good thing that leads to greater fitness(“Understanding Your Target Heart Rate”). A higher heart rate means that the heart is functioning well and is able to pump blood quickly and effectively. Lower maximum heart rate means that either the heart is unable to pump blood at higher speeds or that the person is not doing activities that allow their heart rate to reach such levels, in most cases. Figures 1.3 and 2.3 also show that people who did not get to a certain maximum heart rate, around 140, had a significantly higher chance of heart failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did not use the rest of the columns because of three main reasons. Firstly, many of the variables were categorical (or binary), such as \"fbs,\" \"cp,\" \"slope,\" and \"thal,\" and as we are using the euclidean distance in the KNN classification model, we cannot be sure what values to assign to each category. For instance, \"fbs\" is either 0 or 1; zero represents fasting blood sugar of less than 120, and one is for more. These numbers are arbitrarily assigned and are not the best indicators of fasting blood sugar, and we cannot easily reassign numbers. Secondly, some of the columns, including \"oldpeak\" and \"ca\" are missing many values. We decided that adding one less correlated predictor is not worth giving up data on more correlated predictors such as maximum heart rate. Lastly, \"oldpeak\" and some of the other variables, such as \"slope,\" are not commonly accessible, and our main goal of this project is to find an algorithm that can detect heart disease based on accessible information.

    "## Discussion \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We were expecting to find that people with higher age, greater Serum cholesterol, and lower maximum heart rate would be more likely to have heart disease; our final plots clearly reinforce those expectations. More specifically, we can observe that our model predicts that people older than 50, who have a maximum heart rate of lower than 150 and Serum cholesterol greater than 200 mg/d are having heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The accuracy of our model is about 65%. The confusion matrix also shows 54 observations were correctly predicted as heart disease, and 58 were correctly predicted as no heart disease. Therefore the classifier labeled 54 + 56 = 110 observations correctly. It also shows that the classifier made some mistakes; in particular, it classified 25 observations as no heart disease when they were truly heart disease and 32 observations as heart disease when they were truly no heart disease. While these results might not seem impressive, we have to consider that it is very hard to predict heart disease(Rawat, Shubhankar. “Heart Disease Prediction.”) Moreover, we are only using accessible information, and we are predicting most of the \"Yes\" cases, which is very valuable because early detection and treatment results in a reduction of the severity and mortality of heart disease. Furthermore, we can conclude from our results that great cholesterol and low heart rate are two causes of heart disease. Both of these factors can be prevented with special care and consultation of a doctor. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. These findings open up many other important questions. Instead of predicting whether someone has heart disease or not, we can move over to predict the possibility of the person having heart disease. This will be much better at reducing mortality as even if the person does not have heart disease, we can see if they are at high risk for the disease and treat accordingly. Another future question is why the suggested factors, cholesterol and maximum heart rate, are causes of heart disease. In our projecty, we established the correlation between factors such as age, cholestrol and heart rate with heart disease, but we propose that the causaul relationship between the predictors and the target variable should be explored to help us find precautions that potentially lead to a significant reduction of heart disease."
